## Project
The purpose of this project is to provide an in-depth analysis and application of various stochastic processes. It explores mathematical models and their real-world applications, highlighting key concepts and theories in stochastic processes. The project includes detailed case studies and examples to illustrate the principles discussed. It aims to deepen understanding of stochastic processes and demonstrate their relevance in different fields. The project concludes with a discussion of results, findings, and potential areas for future research.
